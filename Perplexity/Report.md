| 34.522997  |3.3103759   |1.123527 | train 1 | 	   
| 30.27922   |2.789710	  |1.099371 | test 1  |

as it is shown as the n in ngram increases the perplexity increases as well. 
in overall pp is more in test data compairing to train

train for label1 as well as test shows less pp means it has less complexity
on the other hand , both train2 and test2 have more pp , showing that they are more complex and more diverse
it means that the ones with more pp are the ones that each gram occurse less (p is less)
- less pp is better anyways
