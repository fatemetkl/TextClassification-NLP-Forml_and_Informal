# MaxEnt
first of all, I changed the data format to :
```
قدیمی سوال:1 پدر:1 مثل:1 مرا:1 جا:1 کند:1
```
in order to be right for mallet each vocab is a feature and its value is count(w)
and using command .bin moddels were ready to use 
- note: in all the models (NaiveBayes and MaxEnt )  stop words are removed

*important note:
# new features added for maxent (mallet) 
these files are saved in this folder as
`input.train2.txt` and `input.test2.txt`
